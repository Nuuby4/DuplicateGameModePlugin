There is an Import Spawns Button. To use, create a .txt file in this format:
```
AlternateSpawnEntityData, X, Y, Z, W, TeamId, Priority, DefaultEnabled
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData, X, Y, Z, Index, TeamId, UNUSED, DefaultEnabled
```

Example:
```
AlternateSpawnEntityData,-15.470,76.800,140.620,425.0,1,1,True
AlternateSpawnEntityData,-15.470,76.800,140.620,425.0,2,1,True
AlternateSpawnEntityData,-15.470,76.800,140.620,425.0,1,1,True
AlternateSpawnEntityData,-83.230,71.890,-46.190,290.1,1,1,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-112.500,0.000,-5.835,0,1,0,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-32.105,0.000,-6.565,0,1,0,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-32.934,0.000,-79.534,0,1,0,True

SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-20.751,0.000,158.131,1,1,0,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-10.131,0.000,158.099,1,1,0,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-10.397,0.000,105.857,1,1,0,True
SpawnLocationFinderEntityData,-20.799,0.000,105.450,1,1,0,True
```
This might seem tedious but using a to-be-released Unity Tool, you can generate these in seconds
